Middleware is like a set of "checkpoints" or "stages" that incoming requests go through before reaching their final destination (like a route handler). Each piece of middleware can:

    Inspect: Look at the request or response.
    Modify: Change or add information to the request or response.
    Perform Actions: Like logging, authentication, or handling errors.
    Pass Control: Move the request to the next middleware or route handler with next().

Here’s how it works:

    Request Comes In: A user makes a request to your server.
    Middleware Processes: Each piece of middleware runs in the order it’s set up. It can perform tasks like logging the request or checking if the user is authenticated.
    Move On: Middleware uses next() to pass the request along to the next middleware or route handler.
    Final Handling: Eventually, the request reaches its final destination, such as a route that sends a response back to the user.

So, middleware helps you manage and process requests in a structured way before sending a response.
