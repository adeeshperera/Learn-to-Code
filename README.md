# Learn-to-Code 📚

A beginner-friendly repository that teaches programming fundamentals through hands-on examples across multiple languages. Master core concepts once, apply them anywhere!

## 🎯 Why This Repository Matters

**Universal Concepts**: Programming fundamentals work the same everywhere. Learn variables, loops, and functions in one language - use them in all languages.

**Learn by Doing**: Every example runs immediately with detailed comments explaining both _what_ and _why_.

**Progressive Learning**: Start simple, build complexity gradually. Never encounter concepts without the foundation to understand them.

**Multiple Languages**: See the same concepts in different languages to build confidence and recognize patterns.

## 🚀 Core Concepts You'll Master

**Foundation**: Variables, data types, input/output, comments
**Control Flow**: If-else statements, loops, switch cases, break/continue  
**Data Structures**: Arrays, lists, objects, functions, scope
**Modern Practices**: Object-oriented programming, error handling, modules
**Real Applications**: Web development, APIs, databases, user interfaces

## 🏁 Getting Started

**Quick Start**:

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/adeeshperera/Learn-to-Code.git`
2. Pick a language directory and start exploring
3. Read comments thoroughly, run examples, experiment!
